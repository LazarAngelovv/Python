01.	Binary Digits Count
You are given a positive integer number and one binary digit B (0 or 1). Your task is to write a program that finds the number of binary digits (B) in given integer.


02.	Bit at Position 1
Write a program that prints the bit at position 1 of given integer. We use the standard counting: from right to left, starting from 0.


03.	P-th Bit
Write a program that prints the bit at position p of given integer. We use the standard counting: from right to left, starting from 0.


04.	Bit Destroyer
Write a program that sets the bit at position p to 0. Print the resulting integer.


05.	* Odd Times
You are given an array of positive integers in a single line, separated by a space (' '). All numbers occur even number of times except one number which occurs odd number of times. Find it, using only bitwise operations.


06.	* Tri-bit Switch
Write a program that inverts the 3 bits from position p to the left with their XOR opposites (e.g. 111 -> 000, 101 -> 010) in 32-bit number. Print the resulting integer on the console.
